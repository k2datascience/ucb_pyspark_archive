    "# Word Count Lab: Building a word count application\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will build on the techniques covered in the Spark tutorial to develop a simple word count application.  The volume of unstructured text in existence is growing dramatically, and Spark is an excellent tool for analyzing this type of data.  In this lab, we will write code that calculates the most common words in the [Complete Works of William Shakespeare](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100) retrieved from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page).  This could also be scaled to larger applications, such as finding the most common words in Wikipedia.\n",

Note that `concat` takes in two or more string columns and returns a single string column.
