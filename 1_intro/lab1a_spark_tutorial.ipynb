    "\n",
    "This tutorial will teach you how to use [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), a framework for large-scale data processing, within a notebook. Many traditional frameworks were designed to be run on a single computer.  However, many datasets today are too large to be stored on a single computer, and even when a dataset can be stored on one computer (such as the datasets in this tutorial), the dataset can often be processed much more quickly using multiple computers.\n",

Spark excels at distributing these operations across a cluster while abstracting away many of the underlying implementation details.  Spark has been designed with a focus on scalability and efficiency.  With Spark you can begin developing your solution on your laptop, using a small dataset, and then use that same code to process terabytes or even petabytes across a distributed cluster.\n",

    "###### A note about DataFrames and queries\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use DataFrames or Spark SQL, you are building up a _query plan_. Each transformation you apply to a DataFrame adds some information to the query plan. When you finally call an action, which triggers execution of your Spark job, several things happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spark's Catalyst optimizer analyzes the query plan (called an _unoptimized logical query plan_) and attempts to optimize it. Optimizations include (but aren't limited to) rearranging and combining `filter()` operations for efficiency, converting `Decimal` operations to more efficient long integer operations, and pushing some operations down into the data source (e.g., a `filter()` operation might be translated to a SQL `WHERE` clause, if the data source is a traditional SQL RDBMS). The result of this optimization phase is an _optimized logical plan_.\n",
    "2. Once Catalyst has an optimized logical plan, it then constructs multiple _physical_ plans from it. Specifically, it implements the query in terms of lower level Spark RDD operations.\n",
    "3. Catalyst chooses which physical plan to use via _cost optimization_. That is, it determines which physical plan is the most efficient (or least expensive), and uses that one.\n",
    "4. Finally, once the physical RDD execution plan is established, Spark actually executes the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can examine the query plan using the `explain()` function on a DataFrame. By default, `explain()` only shows you the final physical plan; however, if you pass it an argument of `True`, it will show you all phases.\n",
    "\n",

    "Spark automatically manages the partitions cached in memory. If it has more partitions than available memory, by default, it will evict older partitions to make room for new ones. For efficiency, once you are finished using cached DataFrame, you can optionally tell Spark to stop caching it in memory by using the DataFrame's `unpersist()` method to inform Spark that you no longer need the cached data.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Advanced: ** Spark provides many more options for managing how DataFrames cached. For instance, you can tell Spark to spill cached partitions to disk when it runs out of memory, instead of simply throwing old ones away. You can explore the API for DataFrame's [persist()](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.DataFrame.persist) operation using Python's [help()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html?highlight=help#help) command.  The `persist()` operation, optionally, takes a pySpark [StorageLevel](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.StorageLevel) object."

    "\n",
    "Internally, Spark executes using a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). pySpark runs Python code in a JVM using [Py4J](http://py4j.sourceforge.net). Py4J enables Python programs running in a Python interpreter to dynamically access Java objects in a Java Virtual Machine. Methods are called as if the Java objects resided in the Python interpreter and Java collections can be accessed through standard Python collection methods. Py4J also enables Java programs to call back Python objects.\n",
